    <string name="story">The aim of this application is to allow the students of the University of the West Indies Mona Campus to better navigate their way around the campus. This is done by providing the students directions to their classes or where ever they wish to be. The application uses the Google Maps API,the gps capabilities of your device and works by finding the closest building to your current location on the University campus. Once this closest point is found it plots you a step by step path to your desired destination.</string>
